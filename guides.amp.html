                <li><strong>Introduction</strong><br />A new disease named novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in early
                    December 2019 in China and has now spread to over 90 countries. As of 9th March 2020, India has
                    reported 42 cases mostly among those who had traveled from affected countries. It causes a minor
                    illness in the majority of patients with symptoms of fever and or cough. A small proportion of such
                    persons may progress to severe disease with difficulty in breathing.<br />It is spread by an
                    infected person with COVID coughing and the droplets from his cough infecting others in close
                    vicinity (less than 1 meter).<br />Any such new disease invariably related to cough leads to
                    suggestions from various quarters, especially in social media, to use masks by the general public to
                    prevent the disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose of this document<br /></strong> The purpose of this document is to give correct
                    evidence-based information to the general public on the use of masks.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical masks<br /></strong> Medical masks of different sizes and shapes are available in
                    the market. The common ones are flat pleated masks of woven fabric which covers the nose and mouth
                    and affixed behind the head with straps/ elastic fasteners. There are also conical or duckbill
                    shaped masks with valves (or without valves) that fit in the contour of the face over the nose and
                    mouth but are costlier.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of masks by the general public<br />4.1. Persons having no symptoms are not to use a
                        mask<br /></strong> Medical masks should not be used by healthy persons who are not having any
                    symptoms because it creates a false sense of security that can lead to neglecting other essential
                    measures such as the washing of hands.<br />Further, there is no scientific evidence to show the
                    health benefit of using masks for non-sick persons in the community. In fact, erroneous use of masks
                    or continuous use of a disposable mask for longer than 6 hours or repeated use of the same mask may
                    actually increase the risk of getting an infection. It also incurs unnecessary costs.<br />In such a
                    situation, more effective steps are:<br />i. Wash hands frequently with soap and water for 40
                    seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 70% alcohol must be used for 20 seconds. If hands are
                    dirty or soiled,<br />do not use alcohol-based hand sanitizer, but wash hands preferably with soap
                    and water.<br />ii. While coughing or sneezing cover nose and mouth with a handkerchief, paper
                    tissue. If handkerchief or tissue paper is not available cough into the flexed elbow. Dispose of
                    tissue immediately after use and wash hands.<br />iii. Refrain from touching face, mouth, nose, and
                    eyes.<br />iv. Stay at least a meter away from those coughing or sneezing.<br />v. Monitor your body
                    temperature.<br /><strong>4.2. When and who should use medical masks (apart from health care
                        worker).</strong><br /><strong> 4.2.1. When a person develops a cough or fever.<br /></strong>
                    The use of medical three-layer masks when ill will prevent your infection from spreading to others.
                    However, you also need to wash your hands frequently to avoid spreading the infection to
                    others.<br />4.2.2. <strong>While visiting a healthcare facility.<br />4.2.3. When you are caring
                        for an ill person.<br />4.2.4. Close family contacts of such suspect/confirmed cases undergoing
                        home care should also use a Triple-layer medical mask.</strong><br /><strong> 4.3. Duration for
                        which a medical mask will remain effective<br /></strong> A medical mask, if properly worn, will
                    be effective for 8 hours. If it gets wet in between, it needs to be changed immediately.<br />4.4.
                    <strong>Correct procedure of wearing a triple-layer mask</strong><br />While wearing a medical mask,
                    the steps are given below need to be followed. If you do not follow them, you may get infected from
                    the mask itself. These steps are:<br /> Unfold the pleats; make sure that they are facing
                    down.<br /> Place over nose, mouth, and chin.<br /> Fit flexible nose piece (a metallic strip that
                    can easily be located) over the nose bridge.<br /> Secure with tie strings (upper string to be tied
                    on top of the head above the ears –lower string at the back of the neck.)<br /> Ensure there are no
                    gaps on either side of the mask, adjust to fit.<br /> While in use, avoid touching the mask.<br />
                    Do not let the mask hanging from the neck.<br /> Change the mask after six hours or as soon as they
                    become wet.<br /> Disposable masks are never to be reused and should be disposed of.<br /> While
                    removing the mask great care must be taken not to touch the potentially contaminated outer surface
                    of the mask<br /> To remove mask first untie the string below and then the string above and handle
                    the mask using the upper strings.<br /><strong> 4.5. Disposal of used masks<br /></strong> The used
                    masks should be considered as potentially infected. Masks used by patients/caregivers/ close
                    contacts during home care should be disinfected using ordinary bleach solution (5%) or sodium
                    hypochlorite solution (1%) and then disposed of either by burning or deep burial.</li>
